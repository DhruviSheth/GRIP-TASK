                       #Representing the Residual values vs Fitted Values of the linear model through a Scatterplot

#Regression Analysis: As the standardized residuals are randomly scattered, the model seems to be trustworthy 
#explaining most of the deterministic component. There seems to be only one potential influencial point with 
#standardized residual value less than -2 showing it's pretty robust. Otherwise, the model is a good one and the 
#predicted score of 92.91 can we considered quite close to the actual score for 9.25 hours of study.
